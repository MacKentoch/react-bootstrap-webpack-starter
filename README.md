### ReactJS + Bootstrap starter with hot reload

#### Full client and server side in ES6+-ES2015+ using only React 16.3 Context API for state management

> Dev bundle `connects context` to `redux devTools` (_yes you are not dreaming_) to feel redux development experience in a pure Context API app. Contrary to a redux based app connecting to devTools is not automatic (_you have to specify each `pseudo-action` you want to trace in devTools state_).

_Concept behind:_ **this starter is an easy way to understand and ready to use ReactJS (ES6) + bootstrap + webpack starter with:**

- `no hard core Webpack` config so it is more commonly understandable (_they are numerous amazing starters with incredible webpack configs ‚Äî hard core configs aren't bad things at all! ‚Äî. This one is just for easier understanding for people even discovering webpack_)
- `with hot reload` (_ReactJS + webpack => hot reload = WINNER_)
- `no flux` (_yes, to give you freedom to add then since you may want to use something else like observables?_)
- `with JWT auth`
- _ReactJS Components written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, pure render...)._
