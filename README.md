Full ES2015 React Bootstrap with Hot Reload starter
==========

### ReactJS + Bootstrap starter with hot reload

#### full client and server side in ES6-ES2015

A simple `full ES2015` (*previously named ES6*).

*Concept behind:* **this starter is an easy to understand and ready to use ReactJS (ES6) + bootstrap + webpack starter with:**
- `no hard core Webpack` config so it is more commonly understandable (*they are numerous amazing starters with incredible webpack configs — hard core configs aren't bad things at all! —. This one is just for easier understanding for people even discovering webpack*)
- `with hot reload` (*ReactJS + webpack => hot reload = WINNER*)
- `no flux` (*yes, to give you freedom to add then since you may want to use something else like observables?*)
- `no auth` (*simple starter that even fits for simple applications that don't need auth*)
